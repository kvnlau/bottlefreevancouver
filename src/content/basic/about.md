Since 1998, we have been providing professional water filtration services to businesses across the lower mainland. Our water coolers and filtration products are sourced professionally from manufacturers based in the USA, Japan, and Korea. Our vision is to __reduce the carbon footprint of Vancouver businesses by providing a smarter and simpler alternative to bottled water - the bottleless water cooler__. Not only is it more environmentally friendly and convenient, it will save you money too.

Getting hooked up with a Bottlefree water cooler is as easy as 1-2-3.
